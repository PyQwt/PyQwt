[run_sip]
# The 'run_sip' command transforms the sip/*.sip files into
# *.cpp, *.h and *.py files.
# It requires also the PyQt-*/sip/*.sip files that have been
# used to build PyQt.
# The option 'sip_file_dirs' indicate the command 'run_sip'
# where to find the PyQt-*/sip/*.sip files.
#
# If you cannot find those files on your system, see the
# documentation: 'Prerequisites for Windows'.
#
# Running PyQt-win-*-3.8.exe and selecting the SIP tools
# puts PyQt's sip files in *:\Python22\PyQt\sip
sip_file_dirs=C:\Python23\PyQt\sip
# If you have rebuilt PyQt from source, uncomment and edit:
#sip_file_dirs=C:\MyStuff\PyQt-win-nc-3.8\sip
