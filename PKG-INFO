Description: 
        PyQwt is FAST and EASY data plotting for Python, Numeric and Qt!
        
        The GNU General Public License applies to PyQwt with exceptions
        for non-GPL'ed releases of Qt, PyQt and sip (see below).
        
        PyQwt is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library.
        The Qwt library extends the Qt framework with widgets for
        Scientific and Engineering applications.   It provides a widget
        to plot data points in two dimensions and various widgets to
        display and control bounded or unbounded floating point values.
        
        PyQwt requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.
        
        It is highly recommended to use PyQwt with either Numeric,
        numarray or both.  Numeric and/or numarray extend the Python
        language with new data types that make Python an ideal language
        for numerical computing and experimentation like MatLab and IDL.
