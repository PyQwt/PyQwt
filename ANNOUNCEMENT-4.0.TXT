PyQwt-4.0 = FAST and EASY data plotting for Python and (Py)Qt. 

PyQwt is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
applications.

It supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, the Numerical Python extensions
(either Numeric, or numarray or both) and optionally SciPy in a GUI
Python application or in an interactive Python session.

The home page of PyQwt is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.

Main changes in PyQwt-4.0:

1. supports PyQt-3.11, PyQt-3.10, and PyQt-3.9.

2. supports sip-4.0, sip-3.10.1, sip-3.10, and sip-3.9.

3. supports Qt-3.3.1 downto -2.3.0.

4. supports Mac OS X.

5. based on Qwt-20040418 (a snapshot later than Qwt-4.2.0rc2).
