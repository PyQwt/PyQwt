PyQwt-3.7 = FAST and EASY data plotting for Python and Qt. 

PyQwt has moved to http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net

PyQwt is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library.
The Qwt library extends the Qt framework with widgets for
Scientific and Engineering applications.

PyQwt really shines with Numeric and/or numarray.  Numeric and
numarray extend Python with new data types that make Python an
ideal language for numerical computing and experimentation.    

PyQwt requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

PyQwt runs on Windows and Unix/Linux.


New features in PyQwt-3.7:

1. PyQwt will work with either Numeric, or numarray or both (depending
   on the presence of Numeric and numarray during PyQwt's build).

2. PyQwt will work without Numeric and numarray (is not recommended).

3. PyQwt is compatible with the Python Command Line Interpreter
   or IPython, provided that the readline module is installed:
   Qt's event processing is scheduled by the readline library
   through (int)(*PyOS_InputHook)(void).

4. PyQwt is always rlcompleter-friendly, even though PyQt-3.6 and
   earlier are not (the dir() has been enhanced in PyQt-3.7).

5. The module qwt.qplt is enhanced: qwt.qplt is sugar coating for
   the QwtPlot widget to facilitate plotting from an interpreter.

6. QwtImagePlot maps a 2-dimensional array of z-values on a QImage
   using a color scale.

7. New Qwt widgets: QwtDial and QwtCompass.
 
8. Works with PyQt-3.7, PyQt-3.6, PyQt-3.5 and PyQt-3.4.

9. Works with Qt-2.3.x, Qt-3.0.x and Qt-3.1.x.
