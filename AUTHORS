Mark Colclough		<m.s.colclough@bham.ac.uk>

Mark is author of PyQwt-0.10.1, a set of Python bindings for PyQt/sip-0.10.1, 
to be found at http://www.cm.ph.bham.ac.uk/software/pyqt.
He is responsible for the magic of QwtSliderBase.getScrollMode() and the
subclasses QwtKnob, QwtSlider and QwtWheel.  Does he understand it?

Gerard Vermeulen	<gvermeul@grenoble.cnrs.fr>

Gerard has written a few C++ programs using Qt-1.44 and Qwt-0.2.0, regretting
his Python interpreter with the Numeric extensions.  He discovered PyQt-2.2,
wanted a PyQwt to plot NumPy arrays, started coding, got stuck and searched
the PyKDE mailing list.  Mark's original PyQwt bindings and the source code of
PyQt and sip have been invaluable sources of information to him.
