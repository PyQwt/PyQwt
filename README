PyQwt: Python bindings for Qwt (Qt Widgets for Technical applications)

License: GPL with exceptions for use with non-GPL'ed releases of
         Qt, PyQt and sip (see the file COPYING).

Almost all the functionality of the Qwt library is implemented: feel free
to request missing features.

PyQwt is being developed on Mandrake-8.1 and 8.2, Linux-From-Scratch and
Win4Lin/Windows98 with:

Python-2.2.2    http://www.python.org
Numeric-23.0    http://www.numpy.org
numarray-0.5.1  http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray)
Qwt             http://qwt.sourceforge.net
Qt-3.1.2        http://www.trolltech.com
Qt-2.3.1        http://www.trolltech.com
Qt-2.3.0-NC     http://www.trolltech.com
sip-3.6         http://www.river-bank.demon.co.uk/download/sip
PyQt-3.6        http://www.river-bank.demon.co.uk/download/pyqt

This version of PyQwt requires PyQt-3.6 & sip-3.6, PyQt-3.5 & sip-3.5
or PyQt-3.4 & sip-3.4.


INSTALLATION

See Doc/html/pyqwt/index.html or INSTALL


EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

Keyword arguments (like tkinter) in constructors lead to shorter handwritten
code. See CurveDemo1.py and CurveDemo2.py in the examples directory.
This feature will disappear with PyQt's new code generator: sip-4.x.
