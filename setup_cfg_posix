[run_sip]
# The 'run_sip' command transforms the sip/*.sip files into *.cpp, *.h, and 
# *.py (for sip-3.x) files.  It requires also the PyQt-*/sip/*/*.sip files used
# to build PyQt.  To find out where the */*.sip files have been installed, type
# the following line into the Python interpreter:
#
# >>> import pyqtconfig; print pyqtconfig.Configuration().pyqt_sip_dir
#
# If you get an ImportError you must rebuild sip and PyQt with the configure.py
# script instead of the build.py script.
#
# If there are */*.sip files in pyqt_sip_dir, your PyQt installation is suited
# to build PyQwt (assuming there is no version mismatch between the PyQt
# extension module and the */*.sip files).
# 
# If you have no */*.sip files on your system, you have to install a a PyQt
# development package or get the source code. Get EXACTLY the same version!
#
# To find out which version of PyQt is installed, type the the following line
# into the Python interpreter:
#
# >>> import qt; print qt.PYQT_VERSION_STR
#
# If you have an RPM based system, you can get the matching PyQt-*.src.rpm and
# run the command:
#
#       rpm2cpio PyQt-*.src.rpm | cpio --extract
#
# to extract all files from the RPM package, including the sources for PyQt.
#
# To use the PyQt*-3.10 sources next to PyQwt-4.1, uncomment:
#sip_file_dirs=../PyQt-x11-gpl-3.10/sip
# To use the PyQt*-3.11 sources next to PyQwt-4.1, uncomment:
#sip_file_dirs=../PyQt-x11-gpl-3.11/sip
# To use the PyQt*-3.12 sources next to PyQwt-4.1, uncomment:
#sip_file_dirs=../PyQt-x11-gpl-3.12/sip

# Some %ConvertToSubClassCode handwritten code uses 'dynamic_cast<>()' which is
# not supported by all compilers and/or compiler options.
# If this is not the case, exclude the feature 'CXX_DYNAMIC_CAST'
# 
# The option 'sip_x_features' indicates the 'run_sip' command whether to
# disable a list of features (separated by ',').
#sip_x_features=CXX_DYNAMIC_CAST

# To speed up compilation, concatenate the *.cpp files made by sip.  The option
# 'concatenate' indicates the 'run_sip' command whether to concatenate or not.
concatenate=0
#concatenate=1
#
# For development, using the ccache program (http://ccache.samba.org) is better
# than concatenating. See the 'build_ext' command.
#
#
[build_ext]
# The option 'ccache' indicates the command 'build_ext' to use  the compiler
# cache program, if found.  Purist may want to set 'ccache=0', if the
# Gnu C/C++-compilers are symbolic links to ccache (man ccache), but
# invokations like 'ccache ccache g++' are working fine.
#ccache=0
ccache=1

#
[bdist_rpm]
# The 'use_rpm_opt_flags' option indicates the 'bdist_rpm' command whether to
# use RPM_OPT_FLAGS or not. It is safer to use the compiler flags which have
# been used to build Qt.
use_rpm_opt_flags=0

#
[install]
# The option 'install-data' indicates the command 'install' where to install
# the documentation and examples. I want it in /usr/share/doc/PyQwt-4.1
install_data=/usr/share/doc/PyQwt-4.1
# If you prefer another directory, uncomment and edit:

# regeneration of the MANIFEST
