[run_sip]
# The 'run_sip' command transforms the sip/*.sip files into
# *.cpp, *.h and *.py files.
# It requires also the PyQt-*/sip/*.sip files that have been
# used to build PyQt.
# The option 'sip_file_dirs' indicate the command 'run_sip'
# where to find the PyQt-*/sip/*.sip files.
#
# If you cannot find those files on your system, you have to
# get the source code that has been used to build PyQt.
# Get EXACTLY the same version!
#
# To determine which version of PyQt is installed, run
# python -c 'import qt; print qt.PYQT_VERSION'
# or
# python -c 'import qt; print qt.PYQT_VERSION_STR'
#
# Handy TIP for an RPM based system:
# Get the matching PyQt-*.src.rpm (Mandrake, Red Hat) or
# PyQt-*.spm (SuSE) and run the command:
#
#       rpm2cpio PyQt-*.src.rpm | cpio --extract
#
# to extract all files from the RPM package, including the
# sources for PyQt.
#
# I install PyQt's sip files in /usr/share/sip/qt. 
sip_file_dirs=/usr/share/sip/qt
# To use the PyQt*-3.6 sources next to PyQwt-3.6, uncomment:
#sip_file_dirs=../PyQt-x11-gpl-3.6/sip
# To use the PyQt*-3.5 sources next to PyQwt-3.6, uncomment:
#sip_file_dirs=../PyQt-x11-gpl-3.5/sip
# To use the PyQt*-3.4 sources next to PyQwt-3.6, uncomment:
#sip_file_dirs=../PyQt-x11-gpl-3.4/sip
#
# To speed up compilation, concatenate the *.cpp files made by sip.
# The option 'concatenate' indicates the 'run_sip' command whether
# to concatenate or not.
concatenate=0
#concatenate=1
#
# For development, using the ccache program (http://ccache.samba.org)
# is better than concatenating.
#
#
[build_ext]
# The option 'ccache' indicates the command 'build_ext' to use
# the compiler cache program, if found.
# Purist may want to set 'ccache=0', if the Gnu C/C++-compilers
# are symbolic links to ccache (man ccache), but invokations like
# 'ccache ccache g++' are working fine.
#ccache=0
ccache=1
#
#
[install]
# The option 'install-data' indicates the command 'install'
# where to install the documentation and examples.
# I want it in /usr/share/doc/PyQwt-3.6
install_data=/usr/share/doc/PyQwt-3.6
# If you prefer another directory, uncomment and edit: 
#install_data=/2000/light/years/from/home
#
# End of 'setup_cfg_posix'.
