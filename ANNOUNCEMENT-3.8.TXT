PyQwt-3.8 = FAST and EASY data plotting for Python and (Py)Qt. 

PyQwt is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific and engineering
applications.

It supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, the Numerical Python extensions
(either Numeric, or numarray or both) and optionally SciPy in a GUI
Python application or in an interactive Python session.

The home page of PyQwt is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.

Main changes in PyQwt-3.8:

1. New classes QwtDial, QwtCompass and QwtAnalogClock.

2. New classes QwtPicker, QwtPlotPicker and QwtPlotZoomer.  QwtPicker allows
   to make any widget interact with events.  QwtPlotZoomer implements infinite
   deep recursive zooming.

3. Support for Qt's rich text format in QwtPlot to display equations like
   E=mc<sup>2</sup>. Caveat: a truetype font with full unicode support is
   better to typeset of equations.

4. Bug fixes to support event filtering code (see EventFilterDemo.py). 

5. Conversion of a QImage to a Numeric array or numarray array and vice versa.

6. The command line interpreter friendly plot classes contain better support
   for cloning a plot into Grace ( http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace ).

7. PyQwt-3.8 works with PyQt-3.8.1 downto -3.6 and Qt-3.2.3 downto -2.3.0.
