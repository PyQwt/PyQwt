PyQwt is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library.
The Qwt library extends the Qt framework with widgets for
Scientific and Engineering applications.   It provides a widget
to plot data points in two dimensions and various widgets to
display and control bounded or unbounded floating point values.

PyQwt requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

PyQwt really shines with either Numeric, numarray or both.
Numeric and/or numarray extend the Python language with new data
types which turn Python into an ideal system for numerical computing
and experimentation, better than MatLab and IDL.

PuQwt supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, the Numerical Python extensions
(either Numeric, or numarray or both) and optionally SciPy in a GUI
Python application or in an interactive Python session.

The home page of PyQwt is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.


Main changes in PyQwt-4.1:
1. supports PyQt-3.13, -3.12, PyQt-3.11, and PyQt-3.10.
2. supports sip-4.1, -4.0, sip-3.11, and sip-3.10.
3. supports Qt-3.3.3 downto -2.3.0.
4. supports MacOS/X.
5. based on Qwt-4.2.0.
6. builds against a the Qwt-4.2.0 library. 


Have fun -- Gerard Vermeulen
