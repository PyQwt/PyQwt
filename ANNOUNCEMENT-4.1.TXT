I am proud to announce PyQwt-4.1.

What is PyQwt?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the Qwt C++ class library which
  extends the Qt framework with widgets for scientific, engineering
  and financial applications.   It provides a widget to plot
  2-dimensional data and various widgets to display and control
  bounded or unbounded floating point values.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it really shines with either Numeric, numarray or both. Numeric
  and/or numarray extend the Python language with new data types which
  turn Python into an ideal system for numerical computing and
  experimentation, better than MatLab and IDL.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, the Numerical Python extensions
  (either Numeric, or numarray or both) and optionally SciPy in a GUI
  Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, MacOS/X and Windows (any operating system supported
  by Qt and Python).
 
The home page of PyQwt is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.


Main changes in PyQwt-4.1:
1. supports PyQt-3.13, -3.12, PyQt-3.11, and PyQt-3.10.
2. supports sip-4.1.1, -4.1, -4.0, sip-3.11, and sip-3.10.
3. supports Qt-3.3.3 downto -2.3.0.
4. based on Qwt-4.2.0.
5. either links with a shared (dll) Qwt-4.2.0 library or links
   statically with a slightly patched internal version of Qwt-4.2.0.


Have fun -- Gerard Vermeulen
